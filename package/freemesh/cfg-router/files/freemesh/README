WIRELESS.JS OVERRIDE REMOVED

The custom wireless.js file that was overriding luci-mod-network's
version has been completely removed from the FreeMesh system.

The system now uses the default LuCI wireless interface without
any custom modifications. This eliminates the radio configuration
issues that were caused by the custom wireless.js implementation.

Historical note: The original approach involved overwriting the
LuCI wireless.js file, which caused minification issues and
radio configuration problems.
